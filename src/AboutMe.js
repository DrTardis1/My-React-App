                Hi there! My name is Bryce Lynch!
                I'm 23 years old, and I live in NSW, Australia. Ever since I was a young boy, I've been fascinated with computers, and more broadly technology.
                Before I started Kindergarten, I would spend my days in my parent's workshop, in the office on their computer. We became extremely good friends with
                a local IT worker when I would do something that would wreck the computer for my parents. As I kept on playing with computers, my knowledge grew. Being the family
                IT support, I would often be trying to solve problems with my grandparents computers, and my parents phones.  
            </p>
